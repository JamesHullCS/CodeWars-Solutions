# I use the first loop to iterate over the same length of the first list because that is the most important factor for removal
# The second loop iterates over the second list values will be used to compare
# The third loop iterates over the first list which 
# then I compare whether the item of list 1 is equal to the item in list 2
# if so I then remove the matching item from the first list
